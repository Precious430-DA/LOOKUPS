# 📘 LOOKUP PROJECT 2

## 🎯 Project Title
**Mini Project: Lookup Functions and Data Analysis Task**

## 📝 Objective
This project is designed to enhance my skills in **Excel lookup functions** such as `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP`. I worked with structured datasets to extract, match, and analyze data across multiple worksheets using these functions.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The Excel workbook (`LOOKUP PROJECT 2.xlsx`) contains the following sheets:
- **Instruction** – Guidelines and project questions.
- **Lookup** – Primary dataset for lookup tasks.
- **Lookup Assignment** – Tasks requiring application of lookup functions.
- **Pivot Table / Pivot Assignment** – Used for basic data aggregation and insights.
- **Qn1, Qn2, Qn3** – Response sheets for project questions.

## ✅ Tasks and Requirements

### 1. Understand the Dataset
- Review all sheets to understand the structure and relationship between data.

### 2. Apply Lookup Functions
- Use `VLOOKUP`, `XLOOKUP` where applicable.
- Retrieve and match information accurately between the sheets.

### 3. Complete Assignment Sheets
- Populate the **Lookup Assignment** and **Pivot Assignment** sheets using the appropriate formulas.
- Ensure that formulas are visible and correctly implemented.

## 🧾 Expected Deliverables
- A fully completed Excel workbook:
  - All lookup tasks resolved using Excel formulas.
  - Pivot tables or summaries in the relevant sheets.
- A **summary sheet** (or comments) describing:
  - The steps you took.
  - Key insights you gained from the analysis.

## 📌 Notes
- Avoid hardcoding values; always use formulas.
- Ensure formulas are correct and data sources are referenced properly.
- Accuracy is important — double-check formula outputs and logic.

## 🛠 Tools Required
- Microsoft Excel (2016 or later recommended)
